		"abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              The number of secondary cases, i.e. the number of new infections generated by an infectious individual, is an important parameter for the control of infectious diseases. When individual variation in disease transmission is present, like for COVID-19, the distribution of the number of secondary cases is skewed and often modeled using a negative binomial distribution. However, this may not always be the best distribution to describe the underlying transmission process. We propose the use of three other offspring distributions to quantify heterogeneity in transmission, and we assess the possible bias in estimates of the mean and variance of this distribution when the data generating distribution is different from the one used for inference. We also analyze COVID-19 data from Hong Kong, India, and Rwanda, and quantify the proportion of cases responsible for 80% of transmission,\n              \n                \n                  $$p_{80\\%}$$\n                  \n                    \n                      p\n                      \n                        80\n                        %\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              , while acknowledging the variation arising from the assumed offspring distribution. In a simulation study, we find that variance estimates may be biased when there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity, and that selection of the most accurate distribution from a set of distributions is important. In addition we find that the number of secondary cases for two of the three COVID-19 datasets is better described by a Poisson-lognormal distribution.",

		"abstract": "The paper first reviews data on HIV infections and AIDS disease among homosexual men, heterosexuals, intravenous (iv) drug abusers and children born to infected mothers, in both developed and developing countries. We survey such information as is currently available about the distribution of incubation times that elapse between HIV infection and the appearance of AIDS, about the fraction of those infected with HIV who eventually go on to develop AIDS, about time-dependent patterns of infectiousness and about distributions of rates of acquiring new sexual or needle-sharing partners. With this information, models for the transmission dynamics of HIV are developed, beginning with deliberately oversimplified models and progressing - on the basis of the understanding thus gained - to more complex ones. Where possible, estimates of the model’s parameters are derived from the epidemiological data, and predictions are compared with observed trends. We also combine these epidemiological models with demographic considerations to assess the effects that heterosexually-transmitted HIV/ AIDS may eventually have on rates of population growth, on age profiles and on associated economic and social indicators, in African and other countries. The degree to which sexual or other habits must change to bring the ‘basic reproductive rate ’, R\n              0\n              , of HIV infections below unity is discussed. We conclude by outlining some research needs, both in the refinement and development of models and in the collection of epidemiological data.",

We use a transmission model fitted to empirical sexual partnership data to show that the heavy-tailed sexual partnership distribution, in which a handful of individuals have disproportionately many partners, can explain the sustained growth of monkeypox among MSM despite the absence of such patterns previously. We suggest that the basic reproduction number (\n              R\n              0\n              ) for monkeypox over the MSM sexual network may be substantially above 1, which poses challenges to outbreak containment. Ensuring support and tailored messaging to facilitate prevention and early detection among MSM with high numbers of partners is warranted.\n            \n          , \n            Sexually associated outbreaks\n            \n              Monkeypox cases have occurred sporadically around the world for several decades. However, May of 2022 saw hundreds to thousands of reports outside of endemic regions. Despite its not being a classical sexually transmitted disease, the outbreak outside of Africa is concentrated in the community of men who have sex with men (MSM). Endo\n              et al\n              . found substantial transmission among the MSM community and estimate high values for a basic reproduction number (\n              R\n              0\n              ) greater than 1.0 within the context of an MSM sexual network. Fortunately, the smallpox vaccine is effective against monkeypox. —CA\n            \n          , \n            Worldwide detection of monkeypox infections indicates that transmission is promoted by the structure of contact networks of men who have sex with men.",

		"abstract": "Background:\n              A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number\n              R\n              0\n              , variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of\n              R\n              0\n              (2-3), the overdispersion parameter\n              k\n              of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for\n              R\n              0\n              and\n              k\n              (95% CrIs:\n              R\n              0\n              1.4-12;\n              k\n              0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of\n              R\n              0\n              was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.",
