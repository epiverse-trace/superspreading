This vignette outlines the design decisions that have been taken during the development of the {superspreading} R package, and provides some of the reasoning, and possible pros and cons of each decision.

This document is primarily intended to be read by those interested in understanding the code within the package and for potential package contributors.

## Scope

The {superspreading} package aims to provide a range of summary metrics to characterise individual-level variation in disease transmission and its impact on the growth or decline of an epidemic. These include calculating the probability an outbreak becomes an epidemic (`probability_epidemic()`), or conversely goes extinct (`probability_extinct()`), the probability an outbreak can be contained (`probability_contain()`), the proportion of cases in cluster of a given size (`proportion_cluster_size()`), and the proportion of cases that cause a proportion of transmission (`proportion_transmission()`).

The other aspect of the package is to provide probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions to compute the likelihood for distribution models to estimate heterogeneity in individual-level disease transmission that are not available in R (i.e. base R). At present we include two models: Poisson-lognormal (`dpoislnorm()` & `ppoislnorm()`) and Poisson-Weibull (`dpoisweibull()` & `ppoisweibull()`) distributions.

The package implements a branching process simulation based on [`bpmodels::chain_sim()`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/bpmodels/blob/3d892baa64b6bc239d6e4cf4430d7c5f1b4d0591/R/simulate.r) to enable the numerical calculation of the probability of containment within a outbreak time and outbreak duration threshold. In the future this function could be removed in favour of using a package implementing branching process models as a dependency. The package is mostly focused on analytical functions that are derived from branching process models. The package provides functions to calculate variation in individual-level transmission but does not provide functions for inference, and currently relies on {fitdistrplus} for fitting models.

## Output

Functions with the name `probability_*()` return a single `numeric`. Functions with the name `proportion_*()` return a `<data.frame>` with as many rows as combinations of input values (see `expand.grid()`). The consistency of simple well-known data structure makes it easy for users to apply these functions in different scenarios.

The distribution functions return a vector of `numeric`s of equal length to the input vector. This is the same behaviour as the base R distribution functions.

## Design decisions

- `proportion_*()` functions return a `<data.frame>` with the proportion column(s) containing `character` strings, formatted with a percentage sign (`%`) by default. It was reasoned that {superspreading} is most likely used either as a stand-alone package, or at the terminus of a epidemiological analysis pipeline, and thus the outputs of {superspreading} functions would not be passed into other functions. For instances where these proportions need to be passed to another calculation or for plotting purposes the `format_prop` argument can be switched to `FALSE` and a `numeric` column of proportions will be returned.

- The distribution functions are vectorised (i.e. wrapped in `Vectorize()`). This enables them to be used identically to base R distribution functions.

- Native interoperability with `<epiparameter>` objects, from the {epiparameter} package is enabled for `probability_*()` and `proportion_*()` via the `offspring_dist` argument. This allows user to pass in a single object and the parameters required by the {superspreading} function will be extracted, if these are not available within the `<epiparameter>` object the function returns an informative error. The `offspring_dist` argument is after `...` to ensure users specify the argument in full and not accidentally provide data to this argument.

- Internal functions have a dot (`.`) prefix, exported functions do not.

- Several functions use constants that are internally defined (e.g. `NSIM` and `FINITE_INF`). These are used in several functions to prevent the use of apparently arbitrary [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)). Constants are all uppercase to make clear they are _internal_ constants (following [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const#basic_const_usage) and [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#constants) styles. These constants should not be exported (i.e. should not appear in the `NAMESPACE`) as they should only be used by functions and not package users.

## Dependencies

The aim is to restrict the number of dependencies to a minimal required set for ease of maintenance. The current hard dependencies are:

* {stats}
* [{checkmate}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=checkmate)

{stats} is distributed with the R language so is viewed as a lightweight dependency, that should already be installed on a user's machine if they have R. {checkmate} is an input checking package widely used across Epiverse-TRACE packages.

Suggested dependencies (not including package documentation ({knitr}, {rmarkdown}), testing ({spelling} and {testthat}), and plotting ({ggplot2})) are: [{epiparameter}](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter), used to easily access epidemiological parameters from the package's library, and [{fitdistrplus}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fitdistrplus), used for model fitting methods.
