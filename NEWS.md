# superspreading (development version)

# superspreading 0.1.0

Initial release of _superspreading_, an R package to estimate individual-level variation in disease transmission and provide summary metrics for superspreading events.

## New features

* Offspring distributions, not available in base R, to fit to transmission data.
* Functions to calculate the probability an infectious disease will cause an epidemic, go extinct or be contained.
* Summary metric functions to calculate proportion of cases that cause a certain proportion of secondary transmission, as well as which proportion of cases are within clusters of a certain size.
* Three vignettes, including: an introduction to the package, estimating individual-level transmission from data, and the effect of superspreading on epidemic risk.
* Unit tests and documentation files.
* Continuous integration workflows for R package checks, rendering the README.md, calculating test coverage, and deploying the pkgdown website.
