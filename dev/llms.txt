# *superspreading*: Estimate individual-level variation in transmission

[superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) is an
R package that provides a set of functions to estimate and understand
individual-level variation in transmission of infectious diseases from
data on secondary cases.

[superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading)
implements methods outlined in Antia et al.
([2003](#ref-antiaRoleEvolutionEmergence2003)), Lloyd-Smith et al.
([2005](#ref-lloyd-smithSuperspreadingEffectIndividual2005)), Adam J.
Kucharski et al. ([2020](#ref-kucharskiEarlyDynamicsTransmission2020)),
and Kremer et al.
([2021](#ref-kremerQuantifyingSuperspreadingCOVID192021)), as well as
additional functions.

[superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) is
developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious
Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases)
at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) as part of
[Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

The package can be installed from CRAN using

``` r
install.packages("superspreading")
```

The easiest way to install the development version of
[superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is to use the
[pak](https://pak.r-lib.org/) package:

``` r
# check whether {pak} is installed
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/superspreading")
```

Alternatively, install pre-compiled binaries from [the Epiverse TRACE
R-universe](https://epiverse-trace.r-universe.dev/superspreading)

``` r
install.packages("superspreading", repos = c("https://epiverse-trace.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

## Quick start

``` r
library(superspreading)
```

### Calculate the heterogeneity of transmission

Case study using data from early Ebola outbreak in Guinea in 2014,
stratified by index and non-index cases, as in Adam J. Kucharski et al.
([2016](#ref-kucharskiEffectivenessRingVaccination2016)). Data on
transmission from index and secondary cases for Ebola in 2014.

***Source***: Faye et al.
([2015](#ref-fayeChainsTransmissionControl2015)) & Althaus
([2015](#ref-althausEbolaSuperspreading2015)).

[`{fitdistrplus}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fitdistrplus) is a
well-developed and stable R package that provides a variety of methods
for fitting distribution models to data ([Delignette-Muller and Dutang
2015](#ref-delignette-mullerFitdistrplusPackageFitting2015)). Therefore,
it is used throughout the documentation of
[superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) and
is a recommended package for those wanting to fit distribution models,
for example those supplied in
[superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading)
(Poisson-lognormal and Poisson-Weibull). We recommend reading the
[fitdistrplus](https://lbbe-software.github.io/fitdistrplus/)
documentation (specifically
[`?fitdist`](https://lbbe-software.github.io/fitdistrplus/reference/fitdist.html))
to explore the full range of functionality.

In this example we fit the negative binomial distribution to estimate
the reproduction number ($R$, which is the mean of the distribution) and
the dispersion ($k$, which a measure of the variance of the
distribution). The parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood (the
default method for
[`fitdist()`](https://lbbe-software.github.io/fitdistrplus/reference/fitdist.html)).

``` r
# we use {fitdistrplus} to fit the models
library(fitdistrplus)
#> Loading required package: MASS
#> Loading required package: survival

# transmission events from index cases
index_case_transmission <- c(2, 17, 5, 1, 8, 2, 14)

# transmission events from secondary cases
secondary_case_transmission <- c(
  1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 9, 9, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3, 4, 2, 5,
  1, 2, 2, 1, 9, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2
)

# Format data into index and non-index cases
# total non-index cases
n_non_index <- sum(c(index_case_transmission, secondary_case_transmission))
# transmission from all non-index cases
non_index_cases <- c(
  secondary_case_transmission,
  rep(0, n_non_index - length(secondary_case_transmission))
)

# Estimate R and k for index and non-index cases
param_index <- fitdist(data = index_case_transmission, distr = "nbinom")
# rename size and mu to k and R
names(param_index$estimate) <- c("k", "R")
param_index$estimate
#>        k        R 
#> 1.596646 7.000771
param_non_index <- fitdist(data = non_index_cases, distr = "nbinom")
# rename size and mu to k and R
names(param_non_index$estimate) <- c("k", "R")
param_non_index$estimate
#>         k         R 
#> 0.1937490 0.6619608
```

The reproduction number ($R$) is higher for index cases than for
non-index cases, but the heterogeneity in transmission is higher for
non-index cases (i.e. $k$ is lower).

### Calculate the probability of a large epidemic

Given the reproduction number ($R$) and the dispersion ($k$), the
probability that a infectious disease will cause an epidemic, in other
words the probability it does not go extinct, can be calculated using
[`probability_epidemic()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/dev/reference/probability_epidemic.md).
Here we use
[`probability_epidemic()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/dev/reference/probability_epidemic.md)
for the parameters estimated in the above section for Ebola, assuming
there are three initial infections seeding the potential outbreak.

``` r
# Compare probability of a large outbreak when k varies according to
# index/non-index values, assuming 3 initial spillover infections

initial_infections <- 3

# Probability of an epidemic using k estimated from index cases
probability_epidemic(
  R = param_index$estimate[["R"]],
  k = param_index$estimate[["k"]],
  num_init_infect = initial_infections
)
#> [1] 0.9995741

# Probability of an epidemic using k estimated from non-index cases
probability_epidemic(
  R = param_non_index$estimate[["R"]],
  k = param_non_index$estimate[["k"]],
  num_init_infect = initial_infections
)
#> [1] 0
```

The probability of causing a sustained outbreak is high for the index
cases, but is zero for non-index cases (i.e. disease transmission will
inevitably cease assuming transmission dynamics do not change).

More details on how to use
[superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) can
be found in the [online documentation as package
vignettes](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/), under
[Articles](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/articles/).

### Visualisation and plotting functionality

[superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) does
not provide plotting functions, instead we provide example code chunks
in the package’s vignettes that can be used as a templates upon which
data visualisations can be modified. We recommend users copy and edit
the examples for their own purposes. (This is permitted under the
package’s MIT license).

## Related projects

This project has some overlap with other R packages:

- [`{epichains}`](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) is
  another Epiverse-TRACE R package that analyses transmission chain data
  to infer the likelihood for either the size or length of an outbreak
  cluster, or simulate transmission chains. It is based on the, now
  retired, [`{bpmodels}`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/bpmodels)
  package.

  Two main differences between
  [superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) and
  [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) are: 1)
  [superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) has
  functions to compute metrics that characterise outbreaks and
  superspreading events
  (e.g. [`probability_epidemic()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/dev/reference/probability_epidemic.md),
  [`probability_extinct()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/dev/reference/probability_extinct.md),
  [`proportion_cluster_size()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/dev/reference/proportion_cluster_size.md)
  &
  [`proportion_transmission()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/dev/reference/proportion_transmission.md));
  whereas [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) has
  functions to calculate the likelihood of a transmission chain size and
  length. 2) [epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains)
  exports functions to simulate a single-type branching process
  (`simulate_chains()` & `simulate_chain_stats()`).

- [`{modelSSE}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=modelSSE) has a
  similar scope to
  [superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading), it
  contains functions to infer offspring distribution parameters. It
  exports several infectious disease outbreak datasets (see
  `data(package = "modelSSE")`). Both
  [superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading) and
  `{modelSSE}` export functions to calculate the proportion of
  transmission using different methods. It also imports the
  [`{Delaporte}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Delaporte) package
  to model the offspring distribution as a Delaporte distribution.
